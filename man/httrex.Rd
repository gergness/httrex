\item{x}{An expression. If not given, \code{httrex()} looks for code in
\code{input} or on the clipboard, in that order.}

should be printed as inline comments or "details" which uses HTML
tags to make expandable tags. \code{NULL} the default chooses \code{details}
when working in a knitr context and \code{inline} otherwise.}

\item{data_out}{Show data sent to server}

\item{data_in}{Show data received from server}
